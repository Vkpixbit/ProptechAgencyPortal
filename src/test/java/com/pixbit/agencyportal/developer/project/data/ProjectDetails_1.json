		"project_description": "Residential construction describes structures built for habitation. This category can be broken down further into single-family and multi-family construction. But even then, “multi-family” is often too broad a category to adequately describe a project’s needs and considerations. Consider the construction of a duplex versus a condominium complex. While both are technically multi-family units, there is a significant difference in scale, cost, building materials, and engineering needs. From the perspective of both owners and contractors, construction of a high-density residential project (like a high-rise apartment building) generally has more in common with a commercial project than other types of residential projects. ",
